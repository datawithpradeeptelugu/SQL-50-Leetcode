Pattern:

SQL works row by row, similar to Excel.

If there is no data for a particular range, SQL will not create a category automatically.

Using CASE WHEN with SUM and GROUP BY will miss that category when no records exist for it.

But the requirement is to show the category even if there is no data.

So, in this case, we must manually define each category and use UNION ALL with aggregation to return all categories with a count (including 0)


SQL Components:
Union ALL
Static Value across table and Description
ex: Select 'Low Salary' as category
